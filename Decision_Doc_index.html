        <h2>1. Staffing</h2>
        <p>Recruiting teachers and staff for independent schools may be more challenging.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Job opportunities in healthcare, leisure and hospitality fields will also grow and may provide better compensation and benefits that we are able to provide.</li>
            <li>Education (primarily daycare), Healthcare and Leisure and Hospitality jobs are expected to grow dramatically in our area according to data forecasting.</li>
            <li>Median home prices expected to rise to over $1.1M in 2026, an increase from $950K in 2022.</li>

        <h2>2. Enrollment</h2>
        <p>The number of families who choose independent schools may increase.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The cost of living in SCC and migration patterns may increase the number of families with resources to choose independent schools.</li>
            <li>SCC population is forecast to remain flat. (In migration and out migration will balance each other out.) People may be moving out due to the high cost of living for middle and low income families, and people moving in may have more resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="source">Source: SC Economic Forecast</p>
        <p>But there will be a scarcity of school-age children.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The birthrate in SC has been dropping steadily since 2015 and is forecast to continue this trend.</li>
            <li>Since 2015 it's dropped from 55b/1K to 42b/1K in 2021. (That age group from 2015 to 2023 will be 8 year olds and under.)</li>
            <li>The childhood (0-17 y.o.) population is expected to go from 48.4K in 2025 to 43.1K in 2035.</li>
            <li>SCC schools are preparing for a 20% student population drop, planning to close several schools.</li>

        <p class="source">Source: <a href="https://www.kidsdata.org/" target="_blank">Kids Data</a></p>
        <p>However, families may be discouraged by public school closings and choose independent schools.</p>

<li>"The California Department of Finance is projecting an 11.4% decline in statewide enrollment by 2031, a loss of 703,000 students from pre-pandemic 2019-20. Although long-term troubles loom, the impact will not be uniform across regions or even among neighboring districts. The biggest losers will be in coastal counties. Some smaller counties are expected to grow, some with transplants from Los Angeles and the Bay Area moving inland and to the Sierra foothills." <a href="https://edsource.org/" target="_blank">Ed Source</a></li>
            <li>SC county is the 3rd highest in projected drop in enrollment.</li>

        <h2>3. Families</h2>
        <p>Remote work may attract more families to SCC.</p>
        <p>The opportunities for a better work-life balance may attract more families to Santa Cruz County.</p>

            <li>"A total of 56% of employees cited mental health improvements, better work-life balance and more physical activity" due to the rise in hybrid and remote office environments. - <a href="https://www.ergotron.com/" target="_blank">Ergotron</a></li>
            <li>"When people have the chance to work flexibly, 87 percent of them take it. A dynamic that is widespread across demographics, occupations, and geographies." - <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/" target="_blank">McKinsey</a></li>

        <h2>4. Fundraising</h2>
        <p>Annual fundraising may remain steady, but capital campaigns will become more challenging.</p>
        <p>Capital campaign amounts raised have been dropping steadily since 2018 (NAIS Trendbook DASL). This may be mitigated by an influx of families with more resources into Santa Cruz.</p>

        <h2>5. Other things to be aware of</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attrition rate:</strong> The attrition rate may increase due to an economically stressed environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Fear of learning loss:</strong> Families may choose schools that have developed and comprehensive learning support systems to help kids regain learning loss due to the pandemic.</li>
            <li><strong>Social and Emotional Delays:</strong> Families may choose schools that are "high touch" or have a focus on social and emotional development programs due to the increasing number of students who were negatively impacted by remote learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Pandemic funding:</strong> Pandemic funding for public schools has ended which means they will begin cutting programs which may be a bonus for us.</li>
